# Learned wavelet-like transform with a hybrid lifting structure
 This repository contains the official implementation of "Neural Network Assisted Lifting Steps For Improved Fully Scalable Lossy Image Compression in JPEG 2000".

 This work is still under review of IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) -- therefore, only test datasets are available at this stage; full implementations will be available upon acceptance.

 The Authors are Xinyue LI, Aous Naman and David Taubman from The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.
